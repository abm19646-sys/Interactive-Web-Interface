 This Unit focuses on Document Object Model (DOM) manipulation and event handling to create interactive and dynamic web pages. This unit explains how JavaScript can access, modify, 
 and control HTML elements after a webpage is loaded.

In this unit, different DOM selection methods such as getElementById(), querySelector(), and innerHTML are used to read and update webpage content dynamically.
Students learn how to show or hide HTML elements, change styles, and toggle CSS classes using JavaScript.

The unit also demonstrates the use of event listeners like addEventListener() and removeEventListener() for handling mouse and keyboard events.
This allows webpages to respond instantly to user actions such as clicks, key presses, and form interactions.

Additionally, we can  learn how to create, append, remove, and modify HTML elements dynamically using JavaScript, which is an important concept in modern web applications.
The unit concludes with creating simple graphics using the HTML <canvas> element, where basic shapes and fill colors are drawn using JavaScript.
