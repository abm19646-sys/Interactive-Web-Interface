Unit-1 HTML - Structure of Web Pages 
Introduction to HTML - HyperText Markup Language is  used to create the structure  of web pages . It defines headings ,paragraphs ,images ,links ,and other elements used in website .
An HTML page follows a basic structure : the <hyml> tag  the <head> tag and the <body> tag.The <head> contains metadata,and the <body> holds the contwnt that users see.
Common HTML Tags : HTML uses various tags to define elements. Example - <h1> to <h6> are used for headings, <p> for paragraphs , and <a> for links.
Links allow us to connect different webpages using the <a> tag ,while images are added with the help of <img> to make the web page more attractive.
HTML supports different types of lists: ordered lists ,unordered list , and nested list , this helps in organizing content clearly.
Tables are built using the <table> <tr> ,<th> ,and <td> tags . this help us to display data in the form of rows and columns .
HTML forms are used to gather information from user . They include elements  like tyext fields , radio button, checkboxes and submit buttons.
We can  embed multimedia content like audio and video using  the <audio> and <video> tags .
Using  semantic tags like <header> , <article> ,and <footer> helps make the web page more meaningful and accessible .
