Unit 2 : Cascading Style Sheet 
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), is used to design and style web pages. While HTML is responsible for creating the structure of a webpage, CSS is used to control its appearance. 
With CSS, we can change colors, fonts, layouts, spacing  and overall presentation of web content.
This unit explains how CSS can be applied to HTML pages using inline CSS, internal CSS, and external CSS.
It also introduces basic CSS syntax, selectors, properties, and values. Students learn how to style text, backgrounds, borders, and elements in a consistent and attractive way.
The unit also covers the CSS box model, which includes margin, border, padding, and content. Understanding the box model helps in proper layout design and spacing between elements.
Concepts like class and id selectors are explained to apply styles efficiently to specific elements.
