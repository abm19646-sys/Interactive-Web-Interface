Program 6 : Apply Inline , Internal and External CSS styles to HTML  elements .
This program explains the three different ways of applying CSS to HTML elements: inline CSS, internal CSS, and external CSS.
Inline CSS is used for quick styling inside a single tag, internal CSS is written inside the <style> tag in the head section, 
and external CSS is written in a separate .css file.
This program helps to understand when and why each method is used in real-world web development.
