This Unit introduces the fundamentals of JavaScript and focuses on adding basic interactivity and logic to web pages.
This unit helps students understand how JavaScript works with HTML to make web pages dynamic and responsive to user input.
In this unit, JavaScript is used to perform basic arithmetic operations by taking input from users. 
This helps in understanding how data is accepted, processed, and displayed dynamically on a web page.
Students also learn to use conditional statements such as if, else, and switch, along with looping structures like for, while, and do-while to control program flow
and execute repetitive tasks efficiently.
The unit further covers user-defined functions, which help in writing reusable and organized code.
Concepts of variable declaration using var, let, and const are demonstrated to explain scope and best coding practices in JavaScript.
